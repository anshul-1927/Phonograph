NEW: Moved the stuff from the about dialog to a whole new screen and added useful links.
FIX: Even though the Last.fm app and web page say something is scrobbling, the scrobble doesn't actually get saved at the end. Thanks to Tim Malseed for that.
FIX: Fixed the plural typo in the artist list.
FIX: Toolbar had no shadow in the playlist view.
