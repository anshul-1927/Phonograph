FIX: Album image loading delay (white album covers which took ages to load).
FIX: Song detail dialog padding.
FIX: Sleep timer dialog retains its current time on rotate.
IMPROVEMENT: No longer "consume" purchases. This means that your donations are saved from now on. I made this, so that just in case I make a paid version onetime in future, I know who has already donated before so I can unlock the paid version for them.
